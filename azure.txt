Multi-cloud : 
A fourth, and increasingly likely scenario is a multi-cloud scenario. In a multi-cloud scenario, you use multiple public cloud providers.
 Maybe you use different features from different cloud providers. Or maybe you started your cloud journey with one provider and are in the
 process of migrating to a different provider. Regardless, in a multi-cloud environment you deal with two (or more) public cloud providers
 and manage resources and security in both environments.

Azure Arc :
Azure Arc is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment,
whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment
running on multiple cloud providers at once.

Point-to-site virtual private network connections are from a computer outside your organization back into your corporate network.
In this case, the client computer initiates an encrypted VPN connection to connect to the Azure virtual network.

Site-to-site virtual private networks link your on-premises VPN device or gateway to the Azure VPN gateway in a virtual network.
In effect, the devices in Azure can appear as being on the local network. The connection is encrypted and works over the internet.

Azure ExpressRoute provides a dedicated private connectivity to Azure that doesn't travel over the internet.
ExpressRoute is useful for environments where you need greater bandwidth and even higher levels of security.

User-defined routes (UDR) allow you to control the routing tables between subnets within a virtual network or between virtual networks.
This allows for greater control over network traffic flow.

vertical scaling :
upgrading to the bigger server

horizontal scaling :
add more servers of the same size
adding resources are controlled by this type of scaling

azure vm scale sets :
automatically increase or decreases of the demand source

region is a group of multiple datacenters have 58 regions over 140 conuntries

Geography is discreet market of two or more regions that preserves data residency ad compliance boundaries ex : canda, us 

azure geo-redundant storages : replicates data to a secondary region automatically, ensuring that data is durable even in the event  that the primary region isnt recoverable

a region will generally contain 3 availablity zones
